## User Stories (MVP)
 - As a user, I want a styleguide for my website, so that anyone working on the site (including me) in the future will have a great reference tool to work from.
 - As a developer, I want to use proper HTML5 semantic markup to structure my page.
 - As a developer, I want to add the store data to the page using DOM manipulation methods and properties.

## Technical Requirements
 - Styleguide meets basic requirements of the problem domain
 - Working on a non-master branch for the day, with regular commit history

## User Stories (Stretch)
 - As a developer, I want to provide more specificity in my styleguide so that it's much clearer as to what styles are represented in my site
    - Get more specific, and have some fun! What other CSS properties can you specify??
